# SageMaker for Scientific Computation

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that enables developers and data scientists to quickly and easily build, train, and deploy machine learning models at any scale. But besides streamlining the machine learning workflow, SageMaker also provides a powerful, flexible and easy to use compute environment to execute and parallelize a large spectrum of scientific computing tasks. In this notebook we demonstrate how to simulate a simple quantum system using Tensorflow together with Amazon SageMaker's Bring You Own Algorithm (BYOA) functionality.

**To get started, open the notebook _Superradiance on Sagemaker.ipynb_ and follow along the steps.**
